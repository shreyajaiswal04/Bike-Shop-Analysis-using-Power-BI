# Bike-Shop-Analysis-using-Power-BI
## Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze bike shop sales data provided by AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment and accessories. The analysis focuses on tracking KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, and returns), comparing regional performance, identifying high-value customers, and analyzing product-level trends. The project uses a combination of data transformation, DAX measures, and dynamic visualizations to deliver actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

# Key Objectives
**1. Data Integration and Cleaning**
- Data Transformation: Connected and transformed raw CSV data files containing transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories using Power BI.
- Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and ensured data accuracy using Power Query.
- Relational Data Model: Built a relational data model by defining table relationships to enable seamless analysis.

**2. DAX Calculations**
- Created calculated columns and measures to derive meaningful metrics, including:
- Total Sales = SUM([Sales Amount])
- Profit Margin = ([Sales Amount] - [Cost]) / [Sales Amount]
- Year-over-Year Growth for performance comparison.

**3. Interactive Dashboards**
- Designed dashboards with visuals like bar graphs, pie charts, line charts, and maps to present KPIs and trends.
- Incorporated slicers for dynamic filtering by regions, product categories, and customer demographics.
- Added drill-through and cross-filtering features for detailed analysis.

## Enhanced Data Visualization

**1. Custom Themes :**
Applied a consistent and visually appealing color palette to align with the AdventureWorks brand identity.

**2. Dynamic Reports :**
Reports include:
- Regional performance heatmaps to identify top-performing areas.
- Product category trends and their contribution to overall revenue.
- High-value customer segmentation based on purchase history.

## Business Insights 
**Key Observations**
- Top Regions: Identified the most profitable regions based on sales and revenue.
- High-Performing Products: Highlighted top-selling product categories and their seasonal trends.
- Customer Segmentation: Found that repeat customers contribute 60% of the total revenue.
- Profit Trends: Determined that graph shows a significant increase in profit margins due to seasonal demand.

## Conclusion ##
This project demonstrates the application of Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. By tracking performance metrics, analyzing trends, and presenting data through interactive dashboards, the analysis enables AdventureWorks to make data-driven decisions and optimize business operations.
